This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
Generally it opens on port localhost:3000, and all of the web pages are udated in app folder, and you can add or customize based on your choice, and in between have downloaded this list of packages for animations, icons and other components, 
1-> you can start off with this command for creating your next.js proejct[ npx create-next-app@latest .]
2-> installaito of icon pack[ npx shadecn-ui@latest init ]
3-> installation of input component[ npx shadcn-ui@latest add inout button scroll-area select sheet tabs textarea tooltip ]
4-> installatiion of page animations[ npm i framer-motion ]
5-> installation of react icons[ npm i react-icons]

these are the main packages that you have to install, there might be some more packages that i might have missed, so as you do on building this portfolio you will find out which packages to install.
